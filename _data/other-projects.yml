  description: Local-first, agentic refactoring pipeline for Java that pairs SonarQube findings with LLM-based reasoning to detect smells/anti-patterns and propose file-scoped, behaviour-preserving edits. Changes are gated by compile + tests; public interfaces are preserved; static analysis is re-run for reporting only. Run artefacts (plans, diffs, logs) are persisted for auditability. <br> <br> Project made in collaboration with <b>UCL</b> and <b>IBM</b>.

  description: Pixely is a fun project based on image modification/editing. With pixely we can add filters, backgrounds and so on. A unique concept called image steganography can be applied to an image using pixely. Steganography a technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection. The secret data is then extracted at its destination. <br><br> Check out the App <a class="underline-link" href="https://vmc99.github.io/Pixely-Image-Modifier/" target="_blank">Here</a>.
